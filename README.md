# Bank-System
Project of bank system written in C++.
It deals with files either reading or writing. 
Using functional programming in C++,I created a console application which is a bank system for managing clients, accounts
and transactions.

I tried to divide the system into multiple functions and procedures to master its functionality.

There are many enhancments can be added to it, but for now its marvellous.
